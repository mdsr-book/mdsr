\description{
The training dataset includes a set of email subject lines used for classification
of whether the message is spam (unsolicited commercial content) or not.
Many subject lines include subject matter inappropriate for classroom use.
Given the volume of headlines containing such language
(especially for \code{spam == TRUE}), user discretion is advised.
This dataset is a random sample of 80\% of the emails data.

The testing dataset is a random sample of 20\% of the emails data.
